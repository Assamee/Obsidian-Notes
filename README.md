# 📂 Durham Computer Science Notes (Year 1)

Hi, I'm **As-Samee**. 👋

This repository is my personal knowledge base for my first year of Computer Science at **Durham University**. I use this to digitise my lecture notes, practice derivation, and verify logical proofs using **Obsidian** and **$\LaTeX$**.

It's a "work in progress" that I update as I learn new modules.

## 🧠 What's Inside?
A collection of revision notes and non-assessed practical exercises covering:

* **Algorithms & Data Structures:** Trees (AVL), Complexity Analysis, Sorting.
* **Maths for CS:** Calculus, Linear Algebra (Inner Products), and Series.
* **Computational Thinking:** Logic, Proofs, and Natural Deduction.

## 🛠️ How I Use This
I write everything in **Markdown** to keep it clean and portable.
* **Maths:** I use $\LaTeX$ for all formulas and proofs.
* **Obsidian:** Used to link concepts together (graph view).

> **Note:** These are my personal revision notes and formative practice questions. They are not official university solutions.
